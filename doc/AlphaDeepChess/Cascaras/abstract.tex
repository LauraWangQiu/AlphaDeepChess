Chess engines have significantly influenced the development of computational strategies and game-playing algorithms since the mid-20th century. Computer scientists as renowned as Alan Turing and Claude Shannon set the foundations for the development of the field. Thereafter, hardware and software improvements and the evolution of heuristics would build upon these foundations, including the introduction of alpha-beta pruning, an optimization of the minimax algorithm that significantly reduced the number of nodes evaluated in a game tree. With increasing computational power, modern engines such as Stockfish or Komodo leverage not only search optimizations but also advancements in heuristics and, in some cases, artificial intelligence using neuronal networks.
