\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}

Chess engines have played a fundamental role in the advancement of artificial intelligence applied to the game since the mid-20th century. Today, \textit{Stockfish}, the most powerful and open source chess engine, still relies on alpha-beta pruning, but also incorporates machine learning techniques.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent The goal of this project is to develop a chess engine capable of competing against both other engines and human players, using minimax with alpha-beta pruning as its core. Additionally, we analyze the impact of other classical algorithmic techniques such as transposition tables, iterative deepening, and a move generator based on magic bitboards.

The chess engine has been uploaded to the \textit{Lichess} platform, where \textit{AlphaDeepChess} achieved an ELO rating of 1900 while running on a Raspberry Pi 5 equipped with a 2GB transposition table.
