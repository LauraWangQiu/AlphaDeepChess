\end{itemize}
\section{Transposition Table}\label{sec:tt}

\noindent As discused in the previous chapter (see~\cref{sec:iterativeDeepening}), the basic implementation of the chess engine generates a large amount of redundant calculations due to the iterative deepening approach and also the concept of transpositions: situations in which the same board position is reached through different sequences of moves in the game tree.
\noindent~\cref{fig:transposition_example} illustrates a position that can arise through multiple move orders. Where the white king could go to the g3 square from multiple paths.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent Taking advantage of dynamic programming, we create a look-up table of chess positions and its evaluation. So if we encounter the same position again, the evaluation is already precalculated. However, we ask ourselves the following question: how much space does the look-up table take up if there are an astronomical amount of chess positions? What we can do is assign a hash to each position and make the table index the last bits of the hash. The larger the table, the less likely access collisions will be. We also want a hash that is fast to calculate and has collision-reducing properties.

\subsection{Zobrist Hashing}

Zobrist Hashing is a technique to transform a board position of arbitrary size into a number of a set length, with an equal distribution over all possible numbers invented by Albert Zobrist~\cite{ZobristHashing}.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent To generate a 64-bit hash for a position, the following steps are followed:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Pseudorandom 64-bit numbers are generated for each possible feature of a position:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item One number for each piece type on each square â€” 12 pieces x 64 squares = 768 numbers.
    \item One number to indicate the side to move is black.
    \item Four numbers to represent castling rights (kingside and queenside for both white and black).
    \item Eight numbers to represent the file of an available \textit{en passant} square.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The final hash is computed by XOR-ing together all the random numbers corresponding to the features present in the current position.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent These random values ensure that even slightly different positions produce very different hash values. This greatly reduces the chance of collisions.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent The XOR operation is used not only because it is computationally inexpensive, but also because it is reversible. This means that when a move is made or undone, we can update the hash incrementally by applying XOR only to the affected squares, without needing to recompute the entire hash.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent The position shown in~\cref{fig:zobristExamplePosition} illustrates an example of how the Zobrist hash is computed.  
The hash value is calculated by XORing the random values associated with each element of the position.  
Since the side to move is White, we do not XOR the value associated with Black to move.  
The resulting hash is computed as follows:

\[
111 \oplus 69 \oplus 909 \oplus 10 \oplus 67 \oplus 12 \oplus 555 \oplus 3 = 458
\]

\noindent Where $\oplus$ denotes $XOR$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Table Entry}

Each entry in the transposition table stores the following information:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Zobrist Hash}: The full 64-bit hash of the position. This is used to verify that the entry corresponds to the current position and to detect possible index collisions in the table.
  \item \textit{Evaluation}: The numerical evaluation of the position, as computed by the evaluation function.
  \item \textit{Depth}: The depth at which the evaluation was calculated. A deeper search could potentially yield a more accurate evaluation, so this value helps determine whether a new evaluation should overwrite the existing one.
  \item \textit{Node Type}: Indicates the type of node stored:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{EXACT} the evaluation is precise for this position.
    \item \textit{UPPERBOUND} the evaluation is an upper bound, typically resulting from an alpha cutoff.
    \item \textit{LOWERBOUND} the evaluation is a lower bound, typically resulting from a beta cutoff.
    \item \textit{FAILED} entry is empty or with invalid information.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Collisions}

As discussed earlier, index collisions in the transposition table are handled by verifying the full Zobrist hash stored in the entry. However, it is still theoretically possible for a full hash collision to occur, that is two different positions producing the same hash.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent This scenario is extremely rare. With 64-bit hashes, there are $2^{64}$ possible unique values, which is more than sufficient for practical purposes. In the unlikely event of a true hash collision, it could result in an incorrect evaluation being reused for a different position.

\section{Move generator with Magic Bitboards and PEXT instructions}

To identify potential performance bottlenecks, we performed profiling on the engine, as shown in~\cref{fig:profiling}.

\vspace{1em}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Imagenes/basic_move_generator_profiling.png}
    \caption{Profiling results.}\label{fig:profiling}
\end{figure}

\noindent The profiling results indicate that the majority of the total execution time is spent in the legal move generation function. Therefore, optimizing this component is expected to yield significant performance improvements.

\subsection{Magic bitboards}

We can create a look up table of all the rook and bishop moves for each square on the board and for each combination of pieces that blocks the path of the slider piece (blockers  bitboard). Basically we need a hash table to store rook and bishop moves indexed by square and bitboard of blockers. The problem is that this table could be very big~\cite{MagicBitboards}.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent Magic bitboards technique used to reduce the size of the look up table. We cut off unnecesary information in the blockers bitboard, excluding the board borders and the squares outside its attack pattern.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent A \textbf{magic number} is a multiplier to the bitboard of blockers with the following properties:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=1pt]
  \item Preserves relevant blocker information: 
  The nearest blockers along a piece's movement direction are preserved. 
  \textit{Example:} Consider a rook with two pawns in its path:
  \begin{center}
    Rook $\rightarrow \rightarrow \rightarrow$ [Pawn1][Pawn2]
  \end{center}
  In this case, only `Pawn1` blocks the rook's movement, while `Pawn2` is irrelevant.
  \item Compresses the blocker bitboard, pushing the important bits near the most significant bit.
  \item The final multiplication must produce a unique index for each possible blocker configuration. The way to ensure the uniqueness is by brute force testing.
\end{itemize}

\noindent As illustrated in~\ref{fig:magics_position}, we aim to compute the legal moves of the white rook in the given position. In practice, the only pieces that truly block the rook's path are those marked with a red circle.

\vspace{1em}

    \begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}

            setfen=n1bk3r/3p4/1p1p2p1/8/3R1p2/8/3p4/7n w - - 0 1,
            markstyle=circle,
            color=red, markfields={d6,f4,d2},
            color=green, markfields={c4,b4,a4,e4,d5,d3}
        ]
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Initial chess position with white rook and blockers}\label{fig:magics_position}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Magic number generation}

\noindent
Magic numbers are generated through a trial and error process. For each square on the board,random numbers are tested until one produces a unique index for every possible blocker configuration~\cite{MagicBitboards}. Over the years, the chess programming community has discovered better magic numbers. In this project, we use magics sourced from the Chess Programming YouTube channel~\cite{MagicsSource}.


\subsection*{Index calculation}

\noindent First, we mask out all pieces outside the rook's attack pattern or on the board borders, as shown in~\ref{fig:magic_preprocessing}.

\vspace{1em}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}[c]{0.4\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Imagenes/magics_blockers.png}

        \caption{Masked blockers bitboard}
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Pre-processing of the blockers bitboard}\label{fig:magic_preprocessing}
\end{figure}

\noindent As illustrated in~\ref{fig:magic_multiplication}, the masked blockers bitboard is then multiplied by the magic number. The result retains only the three relevant pawns that obstruct the rook's movement, pushing them toward the most significant bits.

\vspace{1em}

\begin{figure}

    \begin{minipage}[c]{0.4\textwidth}

    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Multiplication by magic number to produce an index}\label{fig:magic_multiplication}
\end{figure}

\noindent Next, we compress the index toward the least significant bits by shifting right by \(\,64-\)\texttt{relevant\_squares}. The number of relevant squares varies per board square; ~\ref{fig:rook_relevant_squares} shows this for the rook:

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Relevant squares for rook piece.}\label{fig:rook_relevant_squares}
\end{figure}

\noindent The final index is thus computed as:

\begin{align*}
    \text{index} 
    &= (\text{bitboard\_of\_blockers} \times \text{magic\_number})
       \;\gg\;(64 - \text{relevant\_squares})\,.
\end{align*}

\subsection{PEXT instruction}

\noindent The \texttt{PEXT} (Parallel Bits Extract) instructionâ€”available on modern x86\_64 CPUsâ€”extracts bits from a source operand according to a mask and packs them into the lower bits of the destination operand~\cite{PextInstruction}. It is ideally suited for computing our table index.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\cref{fig:pext_instruction_example} illustrates how \texttt{PEXT} works: it selects specific bits from register \texttt{r2}, as specified by the mask in \texttt{r3}, and packs the result into the lower bits of the destination register \texttt{r1}.

\vspace{1em}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Imagenes/pext.png}
    \caption{Example of the \texttt{PEXT} instruction.}\label{fig:pext_instruction_example}
\end{figure}

\noindent For our previous example (see~\cref{fig:magics_position}), we only need the full bitboard of blockers and the rookâ€™s attack pattern (excluding the borders to reduce space), as illustrated in~\cref{fig:pext_bitboards}.

\vspace{1em}

    \begin{minipage}[c]{0.3\textwidth}

        \caption{Final extracted index}
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{index extraction with Pext example}\label{fig:pext_bitboards}
\end{figure}

\noindent The final index used to access the lookup table is calculated using the \texttt{pext} instruction as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \text{index}
    &= \text{\_pext\_u64}(\text{blockers},\,\texttt{attack\_pattern})\,.
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Conditional implementation}

\noindent To maintain compatibility and performance across different hardware platforms, we provide two implementations for computing the indices:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=1pt]
  \item If \texttt{PEXT} support is detected at compile time, the engine uses it to compute the index directly.
  \item Otherwise, the engine falls back to the magic bitboards approach using multiplication and bit shifts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation with King Safety and piece mobility}

It is often beneficial to evaluate additional aspects of a position beyond simply counting material. We introduce the following positional evaluation parameters:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{King Shield Bonus}: The king is typically safer when protected by friendly pawns in front of it. We assign a bonus in the evaluation score for each allied pawn positioned directly in front of the king.

    \item \textit{King Safety Penalty}: For each square within a $3 \times 3$ area surrounding the king that is attacked by enemy pieces, we apply a penalty to reflect increased vulnerability.

    \item \textit{Piece Mobility}: Greater piece mobility is generally indicative of a stronger position. Each piece receives a bonus for every available move to a square that is not attacked by enemy pawns.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Multithreaded Search}

This version of search follows Young Brothers Wait Concept, which is a parallel search algorithm designed to optimize the distribution of work among multiple threads.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent This is particularly effective in alpha-beta pruning, where the search tree is explored selectively. It is divided into two phases: the principal variation move and the wait concept.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent The principal variation is searched sequentially by the main thread, ensuring that the most promising move is evaluated first. If this move turns out to be the best and pruning is applied, the search can directly return the final node evaluation. Otherwise, once the first move has been evaluated, the remaining moves are distributed among multiple threads for parallel evaluation. The wait concept refers to these threads that remain idle until the main thread finishes searching the principal variation.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent In~\cref{fig:pvsplitting}, the gray circle and square nodes are considered part of the principal variation, while the remaining white nodes are processed in parallel by multiple threads.

\begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Imagenes/Bitmap/pvsplitting.png}
   \caption{Principal variation splitting~\cite{PVSplitting}.}\label{fig:pvsplitting}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\section{Late Move Reductions}

\noindent We experiment with the use of late move reductions, a search optimization technique that selectively reduces the search depth for moves that appear late in the move ordering and are therefore considered less promising~\cite{LateMoveReductions}. The technique is based on the assumption that a strong move ordering heuristic will place the best move in the position earlier in the list. As a result, moves evaluated later can be searched at a reduced depth to save computation time.

\vspace{1em}

\par
In our implementation, a reduction of one ply is applied to non-capturing moves when the side to move is not in check, the remaining search depth is at least three plies, and the move index is beyond a threshold of the 10th move. The reduction condition is formally defined in Equation~\ref{eq:lmr}:

\vspace{1em}

\begin{equation}
\text{reduction} = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } \text{isNotCheck} \wedge \text{depth} \geq 3 \wedge moveIndex \geq 10 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:lmr}
\end{equation}

\vspace{1em}

\par
If the reduced-depth search returns a score within the alpha-beta window ($\alpha < \text{eval} < \beta$), indicating that the move may be stronger than initially assumed, a full-depth re-search is triggered to ensure it is not mistakenly pruned.
