\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

We have successfully developed a competitive chess engine based on an enhanced minimax search with alpha-beta pruning, a straightforward materialistic evaluation, and a Most Valuable Victim-Least Valuable Aggressor (MVV-LVA) move-ordering heuristic.

\noindent Building on this basic implementation, we have researched and analyzed the following algorithmic techniques to further improve the bot's playing strength:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=1pt]
    \item \textit{Transposition tables with Zobrist hashing}: provided an increase in performance by avoiding redundant position evaluations.
    \item \textit{Move generator with magic bitboards and PEXT instructions}: substantial improvement in move generation.
    
    \item \textit{Evaluation with king safety and piece mobility parameters}: showed no clear improvement, likely due to the added computational cost and the difficulty of correlating these factors directly with positional strength.
    \item \textit{Multithreaded search}: requires further optimization of data structures and algorithms for concurrent access to yield tangible gains.
    \item \textit{Search with Late Move Reductions}: did not improve performance, as our current move-ordering heuristic is not strong enough to support such aggressive pruning.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The engine achieved an ELO rating of 1900 on Lichess while running on a Raspberry Pi 5 with a 2GB transposition table, demonstrating its efficiency even on resource-constrained hardware.

\section{Future Work}

\noindent Potential avenues for further improvement include:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=1pt]
    \item \textit{Neural-network evaluation and move ordering}:  
    Application of neural networks for the evaluation function and the move ordering heuristic, following the steps of \textit{Stockfish}, the actual best chess engine. This could unlock more aggressive pruning strategies.
    \item \textit{Advanced pruning techniques}:  
    With a stronger evaluation and ordering heuristic, revisit and tune the actual Late Move Reductions, and implement null move pruning technique.
    \item \textit{Multithreading optimizations}:  
    Refine concurrent search algorithm and redesign shared data structures like transposition tables to support concurrent access.
\end{itemize}
