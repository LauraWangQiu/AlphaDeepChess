\section{Introduction}

In this chapter, we'll measure the strength of the different techniques developed. We run a 100-game tournament with the help of a program called cutechess in different positions against AlphaDeepChess in its most basic version: \texttt{search: basic}, \texttt{move generator: basic}, \texttt{evaluation: dynamic}, \texttt{move ordering: MVV\_LVA}

First we introduce the transposition table in the search.

\ResultBar{15cm}{0.5cm}{46}{22}{32}

On top of that we add the improved move generator that uses magic bitboards move generator.

Now evaluation measuring the king Safety and the mobility of the pieces.

Let's try a risky technique of late move reductions
